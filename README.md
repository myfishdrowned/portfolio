## Description
First iteration of my personal portfolio. This site was built with <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/'>Gatsby</a>, styled with <a href='https://tailwindcss.com/'>TailwindCSS</a>, and deployed on <a href='https://www.netlify.com/'>Netlify</a>.

<!-- ## Initial Thought Process/Project Goals
I wanted to use this project to not only display my projects and current skills as a frontend developer, but also to capitalize on the opportunity to implement new tools. During the planning process, I had general ideas of how I wanted the site to run and look but very little knowledge on how to build it. I knew I wanted:

* A fast, single page static website
* A standout hero page - possibly something interactive or animated
* Smooth, parrallax scrolling and scroll-based animations
* A minimal design with clean typography and a generous amount of white space -->

## Features
* Smooth, parallax scrolling and scroll based animation (Locomotion Scroll and Framer Motion)
* Interactive landing page with animations
* Responsive web design
* A working email form submission sent from client-side (EmailJS)

## Development Stack and Libraries
<!-- After much research, I chose to use Gatsby as my frontend framework because of how it precomputes all of the state in an application, resulting in fast web performance. I initially started off using Sass for styling but the found the development process to be slow so I switched to the utility classes of TailwindCSS. For smooth scrolling and scroll-based animations, I found Locomotive.js (smooth scrolling) and Framer Motion (animation library for React) to work the best. -->
* GatsbyJS
* TailwindCSS 
* Framer Motion (animation library for React)
* Locomotive Scroll (smooth scroll libary)
* VantaJS (landing page animation)
* EmailJS (for client-side form submission)

## Challenges
* Learning how to use Framer Motion and Locomotive Scroll to create smooth scroll-based animations - first time using extensive animations and smooth scrolling in any websites I've built.
* Creating an overall design for the website - ended up changing the design and technology stack several times.
* Looking for possible design inspirations and researching how to implement the same functionality in my own site.
* Researching and comparing different tools, technologies, and libraries that ran well with React (GSAP vs Framer Motion, Next vs Gatsby, SASS vs Tailwind, different scroll libraries)
* Learning how to optimize my website for a better Lighthouse performance, accessibility, SEO and best practice scores.
* Testing the website on multiple devices and figuring out how to make the site responsive.

## Reflection
This project took me much longer than expected. Planning and creating a cohesive design probably took the longest amount of time for me. I spent hours looking at other developer's portfolio websites to get a general idea of what I should include and what looks good. I knew I wanted a clean, minimalist website but I was unhappy with many of my initial layouts. Overall, it was a great test of my design and styling skills. It was my first real attempt at making a website truly responsive and I'm happy with how it turned out.  
  
I really enjoyed working with Gatsby for this project. The development process was smooth and it was easy to optimize my website when I was looking to increase my Lighthouse scores. I believe if I only used React, my performance scores would have taken a massive hit. There was a small learning curve figuring out concepts like utilizing Gatsby plugins or importing global CSS but the documentation is well written and informative.  
  
Using Vanilla Javascript libraries was a pain when attempting to implement them into React. This was another time-sink as libraries like GSAP/Scroll Trigger, Locomotive Scroll, VantaJS all required special fine tuning when using with React. Documentation wasn't well covered so it took quite some time to figure out which libraries I wanted to use.
